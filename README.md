# Bitwise-Manipulation-Puzzles
This is a series of functions that utilize bit patterns to manipulate integers. Each function is limited to using only certain types of bit operations and a certain number of them.  There are three main categories of functions:  Bit manipulation - functions that manipulate &amp; test sets of bits  Two's complement arithmetic - involve two's complement representations  Floating point arithmetic - operations on bit-level representations of floating point numbers.  Some selected examples:  bang(x) - Compute !x without using !  float_f2i(f) - Given float f, compute (int) f  howManyBits(x) - Return the minimum number of bits needed to represent x in two's complement  All functions have a header containing a description &amp; examples.
