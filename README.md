Labs from Computer Systems : Programmer's Perspectives (3rd Edition)

## Lab 1: Bit-wise Manipulation Puzzles
This is a series of functions that utilize bit patterns to manipulate integers. Each function is limited to using only certain types of bit operations and a certain number of them.


## Lab 2: Defusing a binary bomb
The nefarious Dr. Evil has planted a slew of "binary bombs" around the world. A binary bomb is a program that consists of a sequence of phases. Each phase expects you to type a particular string on "standard input" (stdin). If you type the correct string, then the phase is defused and the bomb proceeds to the next phase. Otherwise, the bomb explodes by printing "BOOM!!!" and then terminating. The bomb is defused when every phase has been defused.


## Lab 3: Attack Lab:
Understanding Buffer Overflow Bugs Introduction This assignment involves generating a total of five attacks on two programs having different security vulnerabilities. 


## Lab 4: Malloc Lab
In this lab you will be writing a dynamic storage allocator for C programs, i.e., your own version of the malloc, free and realloc routines. You are encouraged to explore the design space creatively and implement an allocator that is correct, efficient and fast.
